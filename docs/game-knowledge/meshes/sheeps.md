# Sheep

Sheep are the most iconic and adorable creatures in *Tiny Glade*. They wander peacefully around your buildings and love being petted.  
Under the hood, their behavior and animation system are implemented in a very unique way.

## Meshes

The sheep's 3D models (meshes) are located in the `meshes/sheep_animation` folder. There are **31 separate mesh files** used for animations:

- **30** files for the **walking animation**, named `1.json` through `30.json`
- **1** file for the **petting animation**, named `delighted.json`

!!! info  
    The `1.json` mesh is also used for the **idle** animation.

Each mesh file contains a standard set of [meshes attributes](../meshes.md):  
- `Vertex_Position`: the 3D coordinates of each vertex  
- `Vertex_Normal`: the direction each vertex is facing 
- `Vertex_Color`: the color of each vertex

## Animation

The sheep animation system works by **switching between mesh frames**:

- **Idle state**: The sheep remains on the `1.json` mesh.
- **Walking state**: The sheep cycles through the 30 walking frames (`1.json` to `30.json`) in a loop, creating the illusion of movement.
- **Petting state**: When the player pets a sheep, its mesh switches to `delighted.json`, showing a happy reaction.

the original animation last 30 frame but you don't have to make yours last that long, you can loop through your frames to create a shorter one. **but it require the 30 files to work properly** if not, the game crash at startup.

### ðŸ”§ Technical Constraints

For the animation to work properly, all meshes must meet **strict structural requirements**:

- They must have **the exact same number of vertices**.
- The vertices must be listed **in the same order across all meshes**.

This is crucial because the animation system interpolates between vertex positions over time. If the vertex count or order differs between frames, the animation will break or cause visual artifacts.  

![wrong_vertex_order](./wrong_vertex_order.JPG)  

if the number of vertex is not even between models you will get the following error :  
```
ERROR [tiny_glade::panic_reporter] [frame:0] PANIC: panicked at crates/country-core/src/startup/startup_sheep.rs:98:21:
index out of bounds: the len is 860 but the index is 860
```

where the `860` is the length of your shortest mesh

!!! danger 
    If you're exporting or modifying sheep meshes in Blender:
    Make sure the export script does **not reorder the vertex list**.

### Version Notes

- **Versions â‰¤ 1.13**: Each mesh must contain **exactly 860 vertices**.  
- **Version â‰¥ 1.14**: This limitation has been lifted. Meshes can have any vertex count, as long as it's consistent across all animation frames.
