# How to Install Asset Packs

Tiny Glade includes many [assets](../game-knowledge/game-structure.md) that you can modify to change the look and feel of your game.  
**Asset packs** are collections of these modified files, letting you customize things like:  
- Decorations and clutter  
- Entities (sheep, ducks, etc.)  
- Trees  
- Seasonal settings  

Asset packs **replace existing game files** and are loaded when the game starts.

## Installation Methods

There are **two ways** to install custom assets:  
- **Manual installation**  
- **Automatic installation** (using Whiterun)

## Manual Installation

1. **Extract** the new asset pack (usually a ZIP file).
2. **Copy** the new `assets` folder into your game directory, replacing existing files if prompted.
3. **Start the game** and enjoy your new content!

    **Modding is fun but risky!**  
    - Always **back up your saves** before experimenting.  
    - If the game asks to send a crash report, say **no** to avoid annoying the dev teams (but you can share logs on Discordâ€™s #modding channel, click on details, open `log.txt` and scroll to the bottom).

    - The manifest is reset after every game update, so check it regularly!

## Automatic Installation

![Whiterun application](./Whiterun.jpg)
You can use the **Whiterun** tool to automate the process:

1. **Download Whiterun** from [GitHub](https://github.com/Hbeau/Whiterun/releases/tag/V1.2)  
   *(Requires [Java 24](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=24) to run)*
2. **Open Whiterun** and patch your game.
3. Click **"Add asset pack"** and move your ZIP file (do not extract) into the folder.
4. The pack should appear in the list.  
   Click on it, then click **"Install"**.
5. **Start the game** and enjoy!
