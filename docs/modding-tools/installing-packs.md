# How to Install Asset Packs

Tiny Glade includes many [assets](../game-knowledge/game-structure.md) that you can modify to change the look and feel of your game.  
**Asset packs** are collections of these modified files, letting you customize things like:  
- Decorations and clutter  
- Entities (sheep, ducks, etc.)  
- Trees  
- Seasonal settings  

Asset packs **replace existing game files** and are loaded when the game starts.

## Installation Methods

There are **two ways** to install custom assets:  
- **Manual installation**  
- **Automatic installation** (using Whiterun)

## Manual Installation

1. **Extract** the new asset pack (usually a ZIP file).
2. **Copy** the new `assets` folder into your game directory, replacing existing files if prompted.
3. **Start the game** and enjoy your new content!

    **Modding is fun but risky!**  
    - Always **back up your saves** before experimenting.  
    - If the game asks to send a crash report, say **no** to avoid annoying the dev teams (but you can share logs on Discordâ€™s #modding channel, click on details, open `log.txt` and scroll to the bottom).

    - The manifest is reset after every game update, so check it regularly!

## Automatic Installation

![Whiterun application](./Whiterun.jpg)
You can use the **Whiterun** tool to automate the process:

1. **Download Whiterun** from [GitHub](https://github.com/Hbeau/Whiterun/releases/tag/V1.2)  
   *(Requires [Java 24](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=24) to run)*
2. **Open Whiterun** by double-clicking on the `jar` file (make sure you launch it with the right version of java)
3. **Patch your game**  
 The game should be automaticly located and the path is shown in the text field. verify the path or edit it with the **Browse...** button  
_The path should lead to something like :   
`C:\program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Tiny Glade\`_
![whiterun-config](Whiterun-config.jpg)
Then click on the **Patch Game** button to patch the game
3. Click **"Add asset pack"** to open the folder where asset packs are stored. You can download packs from the [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/TinyGladeMods/) or the Discord **#Mods-list** channel.
4. The pack should appear in Whiterun automatically.  
   Click on it, then click **"Install"**.
5. **Start the game** and enjoy!
